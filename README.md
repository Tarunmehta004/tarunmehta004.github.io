## About
This repo contains the code for generating and hosting my personal website on Github. I use this website to track my own learning and offer prospective collaborators a glance into my work.<br>
Most of the settings are at their default values, including use of Jekyll as the site generator. If you are a beginner, looking to create your first website with minimal exertion, feel free to fork this repo.
